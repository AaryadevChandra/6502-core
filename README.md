# 6502-emulator

Currently the project is in progress. The 6502 has 56 instructions out of which I have implemented 1 (with all addressing modes). The project is clock cycle accurate and ... well yeah that's all for now. 

For each addressing mode of every instruction, I'll be uploading some codes that you can use to test the instruction out. I will be trying to make it a bit modular so as to avoid adding all tests in the same file as well as make custom headers to make it look a bit cleaner. 

This is first push so the tests are in the file itself, feel free to play around.

I have used [this](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/reference.html) site as reference for the emulator. See you soon, adios!
